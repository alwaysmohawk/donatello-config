pin: PG12
# 'spread' is the amount of X or Y motion used in the probing sequence.
# Think of it as the clearance from the center, to accomodate the pin's diameter and any
# initial starting-point inaccuracy.
# For larger pins (5mm), increase this to 3.5mm+.
#   Increase this and/or improve the accuracy of the starting point if the probe triggers too early.
#   Decrease this and/or improve the accuracy of the starting point if the motion
#     pushes your printer beyond the allowed travel amount.
spread: 4
#
# Config below is unlikely to need changes.
#
# 'lower_z' is the distance below the probe tip in Z, used to ensure a hit.
#   Increase this to have more of the nozzle hit during probing.
#   Values as low as 0.1mm may work, and will minimize the need for overtravel.

# If using a built-in Z probe to find the Nudge pin top, reference it here.
# This is only relevant for the flipped configuration, to provide resistance to pushing, for Tap/Boop/Poke/etc.
